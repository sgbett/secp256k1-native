# Timing-verification detection floor — a threat-model derivation

## Why this document exists

The dudect gate answers a binary question — is `|t| < 4.5`? — which is a *statistical-significance* threshold, not a security statement. A pass means "no leak was detected at this sample size", which is only as strong as the sample size makes it. This document derives the quantity that *is* a security statement — the **minimum detectable difference (MDD)**, in nanoseconds — ties the sample counts to an explicit threat model and risk tolerance rather than a wall-clock budget, and records why real-world asset value is a weak lever here (the question that prompted it).

Scope: the MDD analysis below governs the **strict** end-to-end operations (`scalar_multiply_ct`, `scalar_*`), whose dudect classes *are* secret-derived, so a detectable difference *is* a leak. The field/point operations also process secret-derived operands (the ladder feeds them the infinity accumulator and secret-scalar state for a scalar-dependent number of iterations — see [security.md](security.md#empirical-timing-verification)), but their *standalone* dudect tests deliberately use **synthetic, non-secret** operand-magnitude classes. Their |t| therefore measures sensitivity to those synthetic classes, not secret correlation; secret non-correlation for the field/point layer is established end-to-end by the strict ladder test. So the attacker economics apply to the strict ops — the standalone field figures are a diagnostic, not a security floor.

## 1. The security-relevant quantity: minimum detectable difference (MDD)

For two classes with equal per-class sample count `n` and per-measurement timing standard deviation `σ`, Welch's t-statistic for a true mean difference `Δ` is

```
t = Δ / sqrt(2σ²/n) = Δ·√n / (σ·√2)
```

The gate flags a leak at `|t| ≥ τ` (`τ = 4.5`). Solving for the smallest `Δ` that trips the gate gives the **minimum detectable difference at the threshold**:

```
MDD_τ = τ·σ·√2 / √n ≈ 6.36 · σ / √n
```

`MDD_τ` is the 50-%-power floor — a `Δ` exactly this size is caught only half the time. For a claim of the form "a leak of size `Δ` *would have been caught*", use the **power-corrected** floor. To catch `Δ` with probability `1 − β` (add the standard-normal quantile `z_{1−β}`):

```
MDD_power ≈ (τ + z_{1−β})·σ·√2 / √n
```

At 99 % power (`z ≈ 2.33`), `MDD_99 ≈ 9.66·σ / √n`. This — not `|t| < 4.5` — is the number the certificate should state: *"this sweep would have caught, with ≥99 % probability, a secret-dependent difference ≥ MDD_99 ns **in the tested class-mean contrast**."* That qualifier is load-bearing:

**What the MDD does and does not bound.** dudect — like TVLA — detects a *first-order* (mean) difference between the *two classes the harness picks* (for the ladder, `k = 1` vs a random scalar). MDD bounds a leak *in that contrast*. By itself it does not bound a leak that correlates with a *different* partition of the secret, that lives in a *higher moment* (a variance rather than a mean difference), or that cancels within the chosen classes. Two things narrow that gap: the classes are chosen to be worst-case for the operation — the `k = 1`-vs-random split maximises the ladder's scalar-dependent infinity-timing contrast, the site of the historical |t| = 875 leak — and **ctgrind covers the branch/addressing channel partition-agnostically** (it flags any secret-dependent branch or address, whatever the partition). What remains is a latency leak in an *untested* partition or moment; that residual is documented, not claimed away.

**The 20-run fraction gate vs the single-run MDD.** `MDD_99` above is the 99 %-power floor for a *single* run's `|t| ≥ τ` decision. The strict gate instead runs each op `N = 20` times and fails at **≥2 of 20** over threshold. That aggregation *does* lower the effective floor — via the order statistic, not pooling: a consistent leak fires in each run with per-run probability `p`, and the gate detects it with `1 − (1−p)²⁰ − 20p(1−p)¹⁹`, which already exceeds 99 % at `p ≈ 0.29` — far below 99 % per-run power. Translating, the gate's 99 %-detection floor is `Δ ≈ 5.6·σ/√n` (per-run `p ≈ 0.29`), about **1.7× below** the single-run `MDD_99 ≈ 9.66·σ/√n` — less than the √20 ≈ 4.5× that *full* pooling would give, but a real reduction. So the two honest choices for the certificate are to **report the single-run `MDD_99` as a deliberately conservative bound** (the gate catches ~1.7× smaller), or to **derive the aggregate gate floor** from the `≥2/20` rule and the 20 runs' standard errors; full pooling of the 20 runs (the √20) is a further `n`-budget option for #79. (The `≥2/20` tolerance rejects a lone transient without weakening this floor, because a genuine leak is consistent, not a single blip.)

Three consequences fall straight out of `MDD ∝ σ / √n`:

- **Halving the floor costs 4× the samples.** The √ makes brute-force depth expensive — the same damping the attacker faces (§2).
- **σ is measured, not assumed.** The calibration sweep measures the per-class timing spread per operation, so the ruled-out `Δ` per op is an *output* of the run, not a guess.
- **The single-`σ`, equal-`n` form is a convenience approximation.** The harness computes the *general* Welch standard error `√(s₀²/n₀ + s₁²/n₁)` (`timing/dudect.c`), and pseudorandom class assignment gives unequal counts and possibly unequal variances. The balanced `σ/√n` form above is fine for reasoning about scaling, but the **reported** MDD (§8) must be computed from the two measured class variances and counts, or it can understate the floor and fail to support the ≥99 % claim.

## 2. The attacker's floor

An attacker faces the *same* statistics from the other side: they resolve a timing gap down to `Δ_att ∝ σ_att / √N_att`, where `σ_att` is their (larger) measurement noise and `N_att` their query budget. "Infinite queries" is not literal — `N_att` is bounded by rate limits, cost per query, and the risk of detection, which is what turns an abstract adversary into a finite floor.

Order-of-magnitude references from the literature (verify against the current editions before citing in a formal assessment):

- **Remote / network** — Crosby, Wallach & Riedi, *Opportunities and Limits of Remote Timing Attacks* (ACM TISSEC, ~2009): with enough averaging, ~100 ns is resolvable over a LAN, ~1 µs over a WAN. This is the classic model (cf. Brumley–Boneh 2005, ~1.4 M queries for an RSA key).
- **Co-located** (same host, shared cache/clock) — tighter, into the low-nanosecond range, but the attacker still contends for resources and cannot isolate the victim core the way the reference machine can.

The decisive property is the same √ damping: to resolve a `Δ` that is `k×` smaller, the attacker needs `k²×` the traces.

## 3. The security condition, and the sample count

Require our detection floor to sit below the chosen attacker's floor, with a margin `M` for "attacks only improve":

```
MDD_ours ≤ Δ_att / M
```

Substituting the power-corrected floor and solving for the required per-class sample count:

```
n ≥ ( (τ + z_{1−β}) · σ · √2 · M / Δ_att )²
```

This makes the sample count a *derived* quantity with two documented risk-tolerance knobs — the **attacker model** (which sets `Δ_att`) and the **margin `M`** (which banks headroom against future improvement). "≈5 minutes of compute" then falls out of `n`, rather than the other way round.

## 4. Where the samples go

The security floor is the MDD of the **strict** ops, whose classes are secret-derived (§scope). Among them, the slow, under-sampled ops set the coarsest — and only attacker-relevant — floor:

| Strict operation | ≈ n / class | ≈ σ | ≈ MDD_99 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scalar_multiply_ct` (ladder) | ~5 000 | (measure) | ~ns |
| `scalar_inv` (Fermat) | ~500 | (larger — slow op) | **~tens–hundreds of ns** |

All four strict ops have secret-derived classes, so all four have an attacker-relevant MDD. `scalar_inv` and `scalar_multiply_ct` are the ones with the *fewest* samples — they are slow, so their counts were kept low — so they are the *likely coarsest* floor and the most likely place added samples buy real security; the calibration's measured `σ` confirms which actually dominates. (The `σ` and MDD columns are filled from that measurement; the numbers are illustrative.)

The field-op standalone tests (`fadd`/`fsub`/… at ~750 000 samples/class) are **not** secret-dependence tests: they compare synthetic operand-magnitude classes and, on GCC 15.1, register a real *non-zero* operand-value artefact (§scope; [security.md](security.md#empirical-timing-verification)). Their very tight sensitivity (~0.1 ns to those synthetic classes) is a diagnostic that the field arithmetic is well-behaved — **not** a secret-dependence floor. Secret correlation for the field/point layer is caught end-to-end by the strict ladder above, so more field-op samples buy diagnostic resolution, not security.

Caveat on interpretation: a *branch*-shaped leak is large (`scalar_inv` skipping a `scalar_mul` ≈ hundreds of ns) and is caught even at low `n` — and is covered deterministically by ctgrind regardless of `n`. The MDD floor matters for a small *latency*-shaped leak, which is exactly the channel ctgrind cannot see (see [security.md](security.md#empirical-timing-verification)).

## 5. Asset value is a weak, √-damped lever — not a linear weight

The natural instinct is to scale the security target by the value at stake (e.g. BSV vs BTC market caps, a ~20× differential). For *this* decision that is mostly the wrong model, for three separate reasons:

- **Wrong unit.** A timing attack recovers *one private key per measured victim*, not the market cap. The loss term is the *distribution of value held per vulnerable key*, which is only loosely coupled to aggregate cap — a low-priced coin with a whale key is a bigger target than a high-priced coin in a dust wallet.
- **Wrong linearity.** Even where value legitimately buys attacker budget, the effect is √-damped: `Δ_att ∝ 1/√N_att`, so letting `N_att` scale linearly with value turns a **20× value differential into only ~√20 ≈ 4.5×** finer attacker resolution — which a generously-chosen `M` would absorb once calibrated (§3; the margin is future #79 work, not an existing calibrated quantity).
- **Wrong stance — the primitive is asset-agnostic.** `secp256k1` is the same curve for BTC, BCH, Ethereum (ECDSA) and others, and this gem ships as *source* compiled per installation — so it is the same **source contract**, not the same object code, that protects every consumer (the per-user binary is not even predictable, which is exactly why the #25 GCC-15.2 reconstruction mattered). You must calibrate to the **most-valuable / worst-plausible-future** consumer, because you cannot re-flash a shipped library when the price 20×s, and exploit-development cost is amortised across all victims on all chains. Weighting *down* by a lower-cap asset would actively under-protect a higher-value user of the identical source.

Where the instinct *is* sound — and is retained — is narrower: asset value informs **which attacker model** to calibrate against (§3's `Δ_att`, √-damped), and **how to prioritise verification effort** across a portfolio of components (the Common Criteria "target of evaluation" scoping idea). Neither is a linear multiplier on the floor of a given primitive.

## 6. The economic corner solution

Put real values into the cost-of-check / cost-of-attack / loss trade-off for this asset class:

- **Loss is high per victim, and the *exploit* amortises** — a recovered key hands the attacker that key's current holdings and all *future* signatures under it (not retroactively-spent funds, and not every consumer at once). What amortises is the *exploit-development* cost: the technique is built once and re-applied to any vulnerable victim over time. So per-victim loss is high *and* the attack is reusable — a leak is worth exploiting even for a modestly-funded key.
- **Attacks only improve** — better statistics, hardware, and exploit reuse erode any banked margin; you cannot patch a shipped, per-user-compiled library after the fact.
- **Defence is nearly free** — constant-time code is a one-time engineering cost at ~zero runtime overhead.

When loss is catastrophic-and-amortised, attacks monotonically improve, and defence is free, the optimisation collapses to a corner: **tolerate no detectable leak.** So the conservative TVLA/dudect stance is the *output* of the economics, not a naïve alternative to them. The derivation in this document therefore sets **how hard we look** (the sample count / the ruled-out `Δ`), never **how much leak we tolerate** (none detectable).

## 7. Re-review triggers — and what doesn't

Because a passing sweep is a claim of *absence* (§6) rather than acceptable presence, the calibration is robust to some changes over time and sensitive to others. The distinction is operational — it says when a certificate must be regenerated, and answers the intuitive worry that a rising value at risk should force periodic review.

- **Asset value / price drift → effectively no re-review for plausible growth.** A passing certificate is an absence claim down to the MDD floor; the code's timing behaviour is a physical fact independent of price. The √-damping (§5) and a generous margin `M` (§3), with a conservative attacker model chosen up front, pre-absorb plausible growth — routine price movement stays inside the banked headroom. It is *not* a hard exemption, though: because §5 lets attacker query budget grow with value, `Δ_att` falls as value rises, so order-of-magnitude growth that pushes `MDD_99 > Δ_att / M` would require recalibration. The √-damping makes that a slow, checkable trigger (a ~100× value rise buys the attacker only ~10× resolution) — far weaker and rarer than the toolchain axis below, but reviewed against `M`, not ignored.
- **Toolchain *or microarchitecture* change → mandatory re-run.** A change to the `(source, compiler, flags, CPU/microcode)` tuple can move the compiled timing: a compiler reconstructing a branch from branchless source (the advisory-0001 / issue-#25 mechanism, invisible to source review), or new silicon/microcode shifting operand-value latency and the measured `σ` — which moves the MDD itself, invalidating the certificate even with source/compiler/flags fixed. The certificate stamps the CPU model and microcode revision precisely so such a change is detectable; it is the reference machine's standing re-run trigger (a `nixpkgs`/compiler-rev bump, or new silicon/microcode), firing on a *change event*, not a calendar. This is the sharp, concrete form of "review over time".
- **Attacker-capability advances → slow cadence.** Better statistics, hardware, or trace analysis lower the attacker floor `Δ_att` over time (the "attacks only improve" axis). This is precisely what the generous margin `M` buffers; revisit `M` and the attacker model on a long horizon, not per price move.

The counter-intuitive summary: the axis one expects to dominate re-review — how much is at stake — is √-damped and mostly absorbed by the margin, so it rarely triggers one; the compiler is the sharp, discrete trigger that reliably does.

## 8. What the certificate reports

Per strict operation, the sweep report should state:

- the two measured class variances and counts (`s₀,n₀`; `s₁,n₁`), and the derived **MDD_99 (ns)** from the general Welch standard error `√(s₀²/n₀ + s₁²/n₁)` — not a single-σ approximation;
- the attacker floor `Δ_att` it was calibrated against, and the achieved headroom `Δ_att / MDD_99` (≥ `M` when the condition `MDD_99 ≤ Δ_att / M` holds).

That converts "`|t| < 4.5`" into an attacker-comparable claim — *"rules out a secret-dependent difference ≥ X ns **in the tested class-mean contrast**, ≥ M× below a [network / co-located] attacker's resolution"* (with the §1 scope caveat, and ctgrind as the partition-agnostic branch backstop) — a materially stronger and more honest security statement.

## Risk-tolerance defaults (the two knobs to dial)

- **Attacker model → `Δ_att`.** Default to the tighter *co-located* floor rather than the looser network one (conservative; informed, but not linearly scaled, by asset exposure per §5).
- **Margin `M`.** Lean generous (for "attacks only improve"), but it is *not* free: from §3, `n ∝ M²`, so `M` 10→100 costs 100× the samples. That is cheap for the well-sampled ops, but the binding constraint is the slow strict ops (`scalar_inv`, `scalar_multiply_ct`), where samples are expensive. Choose `M` as large as the slow ops' sample budget allows — not larger.

## Honest boundary

The *fully* quantified approach — bounding the actual mutual / perceived information leaked (the "leakage certification" line, e.g. Bronchain–Standaert) — is evaluation-lab / academic territory. For a source-shipped library, MDD-versus-attacker-floor-with-margin is the *proportionate* level of rigour; full information-theoretic certification would be over-engineering.
